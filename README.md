<p align="center"><b>Analyzing User Interaction and Conversion in A/A/B Test for Font Implementation in an Online Application</b></p>

This project aims to analyze user interactions and their journey through the application's sales funnel. We begin by studying the funnel to understand how users progress towards making a purchase, identifying stages where users may drop off.

Additionally, we delve into the results of an A/A/B test to give useful information for the implementation changes to the application's fonts. 

These are some of the libraries used for: 

```python
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
from scipy.stats import levene
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sb
import math as mth
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu
```
